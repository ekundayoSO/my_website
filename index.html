        <h3>Software Tester & Development</h3>
        <p class="code-skill-description">I started my tech enthusiasm after my first degree and it took additional 4 years to really begin the journey. In 2022, 
            I joined a crash course on Software Testing and after 4 months, I completed the training and I became A Software Tester. 
            December 2022, I started to learn how to code with the view to becoming a mobile and web applications developer.</p>

        <h3>A Seasoned Farmer</h3>
        <p class="harvest-skill-description">One of the best things I love to do in my space time is to grow my own vegetables, cash crops and rear sheeps and cattles. I have been doing 
            this since I was 14 years old. This is to ensure that I'm free from OMG products which are not fit for healthy consumption. You know what I mean,
            people contracted diseases majorly from what they put in their stomarch. Free yourself from this sharkle of consuming unhealthy food by
            growing your own food!
